// dynaminc datatype while initailizing based on value datatype will be automatically assigned
//>es6 we use (let,const) to initialize variables [js es5 we have var]

//to know the type
console.log(typeof(a));
//number is a datatype

// string
let c= "hello"
console.log(typeof(c));
// boolean
let required =true

//use of assignment operators

let e= a+c;
console.log(e);
//= means assignment
//+operator
//difference btwn var and let
//we cannot redeclare variable of let , nut of var can be done


//!not operator
console.log(!required)
//reassigning
 e="reassigned with let keyword"
console.log(e);


//const cannot be reassigned 
//const is constant


//conditions and loops
